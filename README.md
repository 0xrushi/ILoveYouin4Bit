Android Automation Setup (via Tasker + AutoInput)
To control swiping and screenshots from your Android device, you can set up a local HTTP API using Tasker and the AutoInput plugin.

## Steps:

Install:

[Tasker (paid app)](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=net.dinglisch.android.taskerm&hl=en_us)

[AutoInput (paid app)](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.joaomgcd.autoinput&hl=en_US)

**Create an HTTP Server in Tasker**

Set up a Tasker profile that listens for HTTP requests. This will act as a mini local API for swiping/screenshot commands.

**Configure gesture2.0 Task**

Create a Task in Tasker called gesture2.0 that uses AutoInput to simulate swipe gestures on your screen. Assign this task as the response to HTTP requests.

With this setup you can send simple HTTP calls to your phone to do gesture and actions all hands-free
